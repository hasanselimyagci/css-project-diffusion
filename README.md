# Imagined Recollections: Exploring Memories of Forced Labor through AI-Generated Imagery

## Motivation

* Remembering mass atrocities and the importance of images for communicating the past
* Transformation in memorialization practices with technology and making the mass atrocity memories more accessible to young people
* Identifying influence of temporal, political and situational factors on narratives of atrocities
* Assessing capabilities of state-of-the-art AI models creating distorted images of reality

## Overivew 

Utilizing Generative AI models to construct visual representations of forced labor victims’ memories.

## Technical Aspects

For text analysis part, 
* Keyphrase and descriptive phrases extraction utilizing PoS tagging token classifier models
For image generation,
* Pretrained Stable Diffusion model for Text-to-Image (Further experiments with Image-to-Image model)
* Leveraging GPT-Neo model to generate better prompts given extracted keyphrases
* Prompt weighing and negative prompts to improve quality of images
* Further improving aesthetics and prompt-image alignment with implementing RL approaches

## Discussion and Findings

* Paucity of available data distorts the representation
* AI can promote false information concerning atrocities and enable propaganda
* Lack of ‘empathy’ in models can lead to feeling-ignoring content
* Training diffusion models are computationally expensive
* Remembering forced labor can help reflecting ideas to current rights and justice issues concerning labor exploitation
* AI can empower individuals who want to contribute to memorialization practices with limitless creativity (although limited through explicit list of banned prompts)
* Models trained on different language texts help us understand different narratives among cultures and memory politics
